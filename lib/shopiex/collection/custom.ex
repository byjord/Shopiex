  Manage a store's custom collections. A custom collection is one where products are included manually, as opposed to being included automatically because they meet selection conditions.

  Collections are typically displayed to customers so that buyers can select to view only the products in the collection. Shopify stores start with a single custom collection called frontpageâ€”the collection of products shown on the front page of the online store.
